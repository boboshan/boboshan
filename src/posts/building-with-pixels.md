excerpt: Exploring the aesthetics of pixel art in modern web design and how to implement it effectively.

Pixel art isn't just nostalgia—it's a design philosophy. In a world of infinite resolution and smooth gradients, the deliberate constraint of pixels forces clarity and intention in every design decision.

When building this site, I embraced pixel aesthetics not just visually, but systematically:

- Pixel-perfect fonts (Press Start 2P, VT323)
- Sharp, defined borders and containers
- Limited color palette for cohesion
- Grid-based layouts that respect the pixel grid

The challenge is making pixel art feel modern. CSS transforms, subtle hover effects, and responsive design help bridge the gap between retro aesthetics and contemporary user expectations.

The Game of Life background serves as both decoration and interaction. Each cell is a pixel, creating a living, breathing canvas that responds to user input. It's pixel art that evolves.

Constraints breed creativity. By limiting ourselves to pixels, we focus on what matters: clear communication, purposeful interaction, and memorable experiences.
