Hello, world. The traditional first program, the digital equivalent of a handshake. But this isn't just any "Hello World"—this is mine.

Building a personal website in 2026 might seem anachronistic. We have social media, we have platforms, we have a dozen ways to broadcast our thoughts to the void. So why build from scratch?

Because ownership matters. This site is mine—every pixel, every line of code, every deliberate design decision. It's a digital garden where I can experiment, share ideas, and create without algorithmic interference.

I chose Svelte 5 for its elegance and performance. The runes system (`$state`, `$derived`) makes reactivity feel natural. UnoCSS provides utility-first styling without the weight. The Game of Life background isn't just decoration—it's a statement about emergence, complexity, and the beauty that arises from simple rules.

This site will evolve. Posts will be written, projects will be showcased, ideas will be explored. Like the cellular automaton that powers its background, it's alive—growing, changing, responding to input.

So hello, world. Let's see what emerges from this digital petri dish.
